    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;“For vaccines, clinical trials are one thing, real life is another.” In February, an unprecedented campaign was launched in Serrana, a small city in southeastern Brazil, and in just two months, nearly every eligible adult in town was vaccinated with China’s Koxin vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the fate of the city today?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On May 7, the Wall Street Journal detailed the current status of the small town: Compared to the peak of the outbreak in March, Serrana’s infection rate has dropped by 75 percent, and among those who received two doses of the vaccine, there have been no deaths due to the new coronavirus, and life is slowly returning to normal. This also shows that the Coxin vaccine is effective not only against the new coronavirus, but also against the P.1 mutant strain that swept Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials and people in the small town are now excited. Mayor Léo Capitelli praised, “The (outbreak) numbers say it all, we did it!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street Journal also wrote in its report, “The trial, conducted in Cyrenaica, offers hope to countries around the world still battling the new crown epidemic that mass vaccination has worked. It also provides new evidence of the effectiveness of the Coxin vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rocket standing on the launch pad does not show its height from this distance, it does not look anything extraordinary, but once it ignites and takes off, it immediately becomes unlike something on this earthly world, full of brilliant divinity that eclipses the whole world …… That is a passion that originates from the origin of life, and perhaps it was this passion that made life on earth crawl from the ocean to the land hundreds of millions of years ago.&lt;br&gt;–Liu Cixin, 《Grounded on th Earth, Looking up to the Stars–What Liu Cixin Thought of Watching the Launch of the Dark Matter Particle Detection Satellite》&lt;/p&gt;
