        <p>“For vaccines, clinical trials are one thing, real life is another.” In February, an unprecedented campaign was launched in Serrana, a small city in southeastern Brazil, and in just two months, nearly every eligible adult in town was vaccinated with China’s Koxin vaccine.</p>
<p>What is the fate of the city today?</p>
<p>On May 7, the Wall Street Journal detailed the current status of the small town: Compared to the peak of the outbreak in March, Serrana’s infection rate has dropped by 75 percent, and among those who received two doses of the vaccine, there have been no deaths due to the new coronavirus, and life is slowly returning to normal. This also shows that the Coxin vaccine is effective not only against the new coronavirus, but also against the P.1 mutant strain that swept Brazil.</p>
<p>Officials and people in the small town are now excited. Mayor Léo Capitelli praised, “The (outbreak) numbers say it all, we did it!”</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal also wrote in its report, “The trial, conducted in Cyrenaica, offers hope to countries around the world still battling the new crown epidemic that mass vaccination has worked. It also provides new evidence of the effectiveness of the Coxin vaccine.”</p>

<span id="more"></span>
<br>

<p><strong>“A special experiment”</strong></p>
<p>It all started a few months ago. Serrana is a small city in the state of São Paulo in southeastern Brazil, with a population of about 45,000. It was originally picturesque, with sugarcane fields scattered across the city’s suburbs, and boasted one of the largest sugar mills in Brazil. But a new crown epidemic has shattered the health care system here, and residents are on edge.</p>
<p>Marcos Borges, coordinator of the vaccine program at the Serrana National Hospital, said a study in July 2020 showed that “5 percent of the population carries the active New Coronavirus - that’s one in 20 people, which is a very high rate.”</p>
<p>For its part, the local health department said the number of confirmed cases in Serrana peaked in January 2021 with 706 people infected with the new coronavirus, and at one point the hospital’s intensive care ward was so crowded. “People had to stand there (in the ward).”</p>
<p>Of course, the rampant spread of the mutant strain P.1 has made the local outbreak situation even more dire. The P.1 strain was first identified in Brazil in January of this year and quickly spread to other countries and regions of the world. After tracking and analyzing the new coronavirus variant P.1 found in Manaus, the capital of the northern Brazilian state of Amazonas, researchers pointed out that this variant is more contagious and is feared to cause secondary infection in patients with new coronavirus pneumonia, in addition to evading antibodies.</p>
<p>According to the local health department’s estimate, at least 60% of new coronavirus infections in Serrana in March this year were caused by the P.1 strain.</p>

<br>

<p>Against this backdrop, Brazil’s top vaccine research institute, the Butantan Institute, has joined forces with the local government and hospital in Celana to launch Project S, a program to protect the health of the local population while also testing the effectiveness of the Coxin vaccine in real life.</p>
<p>Science News, a leading American academic journal, analyzed Serrana as a “perfect test site. For one thing, Serrana’s proximity to the Butantan Institute and the University of São Paulo makes it a great geographic location. In addition, the small town has a small population of 45,000, of which about 30,000 are adults, and the infection rate is relatively high.</p>
<p>When Project S was launched in February of this year, the team at the Butantan Institute set a goal of vaccinating at least 80% of the city’s residents over the age of 18. The vaccine they chose was the Kexing vaccine from China.</p>
<p>Previously, the Kexing vaccine had a rocky fate in Brazil, once embroiled in a political battle. Doria, the governor of São Paulo state, who intends to run for the next presidency, said publicly last October that the Kexing vaccine was “the safest and most promising.</p>
<p>Then in November, the death of a volunteer in a vaccine trial led Brazil’s National Health Surveillance Agency (ANVISA) to issue a statement saying there were “serious adverse reactions” to the vaccine, which prompted foreign media to follow the story. Brazilian President Bosonaro, nicknamed “Tropical Trump”, also spoke out against the Coxin vaccine during this period.</p>
<p>However, it turned out that the death of the volunteer was due to suicide and not related to the vaccine. According to many media, the decision of the Brazilian National Health Surveillance Agency to suspend the vaccine may be related to the “political tug-of-war” in the Brazilian political arena.</p>
<p>Against the backdrop of the harsh public opinion on the Coxin vaccine, the Butantan Institute officially opened the “Project S” in February. According to the Wall Street Journal, this is a “special experiment”.</p>
<p>Officials in Serrana have said that the most surprising thing was that almost everyone agreed to the injection. According to a poll conducted in Brazil last December, half of those surveyed said they would refuse to receive any vaccine made in China.</p>

<p><strong>“A lot of people think we’re guinea pigs, but it’s a blessing.”</strong></p>
<p>Between the short two-month period of February and April, nearly all eligible adults in the city were vaccinated with the Coxin vaccine. With the exception of minors under the age of 18, adult women who were pregnant or breastfeeding, and others with serious health problems, 27,700 people were eligible for the vaccine, and 27,160 of them received the Coxin vaccine, a 98 percent vaccination rate.</p>
<p>So what are the results of this vaccination campaign? Mayor Capitelli told the Wall Street Journal, “The numbers speak for themselves, we did it!”</p>
<p>Of course, the numbers speak for themselves. In terms of the number of cases of the infection, the number of new confirmed cases in Serrana peaked in February at 706. The number of infections then began to decline, with 484 cases in February, 692 in March, and a sharp drop in April, with only 235 confirmed cases.</p>
<p>And according to data from the São Paulo state government, six people died of neoconiosis after vaccination during the program’s vaccination period from mid-February to mid-April Five of them received only one dose, and another developed symptoms shortly after the second dose, leading researchers to believe that the patient was already infected at the time of the second dose. Of those who did not receive the vaccine, 14 died.</p>
<p>In addition, the Wall Street Journal mentioned that this result could also indicate that the Coxin vaccine is effective against the P.1 mutant strain.</p>
<p>Lucia Elaine Caldano, an administrator at Serrana Hospital’s intensive care unit, told the Wall Street Journal in May that only one person has been on a ventilator in the past three weeks, or a woman who refused to be vaccinated. “(Project S) had a lot of fuss at first, and a lot of people thought we were guinea pigs, but it’s been a blessing.”</p>

<br>

<p>At the beginning of May, none of the beds in Serrana’s Santa Casa Hospital and the city’s Basic Healthcare Unit (BHU) were in use, and the number of people waiting for intensive care unit beds had dropped to zero.</p>
<p>Life in Cyrenaica is gradually returning to normal. In downtown Cyrenaica, children squeal and laugh as they walk through the main square, many stopping without masks to chat and soak up the afternoon sun.</p>
<p>“We feel very free,” said Homero Cavalheri, a 68-year-old retired architect who no longer locks himself in his home for the afternoon. He takes a walk with his wife, Irene, and their one-year-old grandson.</p>
<p>“It’s like we’re living in a cocoon in the middle of Brazil, and that’s a relief,” says Jesuel Sacoman, a local electrician.</p>
<p>The economy is starting to recover. Ricardo Aranda, a 48-year-old hotel owner, says Serrana has become “the most popular place to park” because everyone knows “it’s safer. “. Business is starting to return to normal, with more than half of the rooms filled.</p>
<p>Mayor Capitelli said several textile mills and other companies have approached the government about doing business in Serrana because the local population has been vaccinated, reducing the risk of work stoppages due to the outbreak. In addition, Serrana’s reputation for Project S is helping to attract business.</p>
<p>“Our little town will be the ‘golden boy’ of the region (São Paulo State),” Capitelli said confidently. Capitelli says confidently.</p>
<p>But even so, local authorities are asking people to wear masks and keep social distance.</p>
<p><strong>“Bringing hope to the world”</strong></p>
<p>In response to the current situation in Cyrenaica, the Wall Street Journal wrote this in its report, “The trial, conducted in the city of Cyrenaica, offers hope to countries around the world still battling the new crown outbreak that mass vaccination worked. It also provides new evidence of the effectiveness of the Coxin vaccine. The vaccine is now being rolled out within dozens of developing countries, from Egypt to the Philippines.”</p>
<p>However, there have been previous foreign media claims of transparency in the publication of data on the Coxin vaccine, and its relatively low effectiveness. This became the focus of outside attention. On April 11, the Butantan Institute published the final results of a phase III clinical trial of China’s Kexing’s new crown vaccine, kerafol, in Brazil.</p>
<p>At the time, the study was led by the Butantan Institute and the subjects were high-risk healthcare workers from 16 centers in Brazil, totaling 12,396 people. The data have now been submitted to the Lancet, a leading medical journal, pending peer review.</p>
<p>From the data in the report, the efficacy of the Coxin vaccine in preventing all new crown cases in settings with higher viral exposure was 50.7%, and the efficacy of protection against intermediate and severe disease was 83.7% and 100%, respectively. The vaccine was safe and all serious adverse reactions, in the end, proved to be unrelated to the vaccine.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal also quoted researchers in its latest report as saying, “The trial’s volunteers were medical professionals, the researchers said, unlike phase III trials of other vaccines, such as Pfizer’s vaccine, in which volunteers were exposed to higher viral loads that may have led to slightly lower efficacy rates.”</p>
<p>More important, of course, is that the Serrana trial demonstrated the effectiveness of the Coxin vaccine in the real world.</p>
<p>Ernesto Marques, a virologist at the University of Pittsburgh, told Science News, “Clinical trials are one thing, the real world is another. Having immune neighbors, for example, may have an important impact on how effective a vaccine actually is.”</p>
<p>“What’s the difference between a vaccine with 95 percent personal protective efficacy and a vaccine with more than 50 percent personal protective efficacy? We would have to give 80% or 85% of the population a (95% effectiveness) vaccine to get the disease under control, and we would have to give the latter (50% effectiveness vaccine) to everyone to get the same results.”</p>
<p>Marcos said he believes that even though the individual protective effectiveness of the Coxin vaccine is relatively low, the results will show the collective protective capacity of the Coxin vaccine. This is important not only for Brazil, but also for all other countries that have adopted this vaccine, such as Indonesia and Turkey. “The results of Serrana’s study will have a significant impact on vaccination strategies in other places where the Coxin vaccine is used.”</p>
<p>This trial in Celana, however, is still in the follow-up phase. Ethel Maciel, an epidemiologist at the Federal University of Espírito Santo, attributed the drop in the number of new crown cases in Serrana to an apparent “impact of vaccination.”</p>
<p>But Borges believes more caution is needed when linking all these changes to mass vaccination. He said, “We are still looking at it and when we get the results we will be able to determine if these events are related.” The Butantan Institute also declined to comment until the results of the trial are released at the end of this month.</p>
<p>Science News said Project S will continue for another year, tracking any issues that arise. For example, how long the vaccine can provide protection is critical to helping Brazil and the rest of the world find a way out of the pandemic.</p>
